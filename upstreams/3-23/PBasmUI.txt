PBasmUI - Version 3.22 by Horst Schaeffer
-----------------------------------------
Compiled with PB 5.61  

PBasmUI is a user interface for the command line compiler with 
the option to produce the assembler file.
PBasmUI is used as an add-on tool in the PureBasic IDE.

Features:
    Generate Assembler file (PB option /COMMENTED) and open it     
    Produce EXE file, optionally run program     
    Re-assemble current asm file (/REASM) 
    Change/add options
    Error messages are captured

PBasmUI.exe expects the PB source file as command parameter. 
The compiler options to preset the user interface settings are taken..
    ..either from the file <source>.cfg, e.g. "PBasmUI.pb.cfg", (if found) 
    ..or from the footer of the source file (commented and normally invisible).

The resulting ASM file ("PureBasic.asm") as well as the report file 
("PBasmUI.log") are written to the source directory. 

Note: The EXE file is produced in any case. If deselected, it will be redirected:
    .. normal production: to the %temp% directory 
    .. for REASM: to "(SourceName)_reAsm.exe" in the source directory

To use PBasmUI.exe as add-on tool in the PB editor: 

    Command line:   "PBasmUI.exe"   with path
    Arguments:      "%FILE"         (in quote marks!)
    
    The path of the PB compiler is obtained from the environment variable. 

How to..
--------
Produce Assembler file (/COMMENTED):
    Check "Open PureBasic.asm".
    This file will be stored in the COMPILERS directory. Select to open the file
    with Notepad or with the application associatd with .ASM.

    Make sure that the source file and all IncludeFile's have been saved in the
    IDE!

Assemble latest PureBasic.asm (/REASM):
    Check (Source) "/REASM current ASM file" (only possible if file available)
    Make sure that the current "PureBasic.asm" is the one you want to re-assemble.
