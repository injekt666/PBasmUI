# PBasmUI Upstreams Archive

This folder contains copies of Horst Schaeffer's __PBasmUI__ releases, as found on his website:

- http://horstmuc.de/pb.htm


Beside keeping an historical archive of __PBasmUI__'s original sources, the purpose of this upstreams archive is to help integrating changes from Horst's releases into my branched code, by diffing the source files of his latest release with those of the upstream release this project was built on, or of the latest upstream release whose changes have been integrated.

# Contents

- [`History.txt`](./History.txt) — Changelog file from latest release

Each release is in a subfolder named after its version number, with a hyphen separator insted of the dot:
