# PBasmUI

    PureBASIC v5.61 | Windows

This project is an offshoot of Horst Schaeffer's __PBasmUI__ --- a PureBASIC IDE Add-In to create, view, edit and re-assemble the intermediate assembly code from PureBASIC source files:

# About This Project

I wanted to tweak Horst's __PBasmUI__ to my personal needs, so I contacted him and asked permission to do so. He kindly consented to my request, and this repository was born.

## Initial Commit 

This repository takes off from Horst's original source files from __PBasmUI v3.21__ --- and this is the current state of the source files, which are unaltered so far! As I'll manage to implement the desired tweaks and new features, I'll be pushing them to the repo.

Horst and I had quite a few email exchanges on the possible features enhancements and changes to implement in __PBasmUI__, and how we could go about them. Having the code accessible on GitHub will now allow us to carry on the exchange through live code examples, and experiment with branches.

It's too early to predict if this project will become an independent offshot of __PBasmUI__, or if might instead become the furnace and testground of its  future official releases. Right now, I'm just publishing the original source code that can be found at Horsts' website, so I can start implementing, testing and sharing ideas.
